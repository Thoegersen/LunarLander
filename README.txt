LunarLander

Tells if a thruster should be on or off when landing depending on the altitude of the lander.

If the lander is above altitude 100 the thruster should be off
If the lander is between the altitude 100 and above altitude 0 the thruster should be on
If the landers altitude is = 0 (the lander has touched down) the thruster should be off
